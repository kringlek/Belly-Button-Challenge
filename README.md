# Belly Button Challenge

  This code creates a horizontal bar chart with a dropdown menu to display the top 10 OTUs found in that individual, creates a bubble chart that displays each sample, displays the sample metadata (individual's demographic information), and displays each key-value pair from the metadata JSON object.  This is all displayed on a website.
